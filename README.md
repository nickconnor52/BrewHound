# [Brew Hound](brew-hound.herokuapp.com) 

## Description

This Java based website was developed as a team of 3 in an agile environment. This was the final capstone project for my curriculum with Tech Elevator in the Fall of 2017. It is an ongoing project that I am using as practice to continue my learning.

The idea was to create a website to allow users to research and learn about the different breweries and beers in the Columbus area. Brewers can modify their beer selection, users can write reviews, and admins can update the database with users, breweries, and beers. The Google Maps API was also included to allow users to locate their favorite breweries.
